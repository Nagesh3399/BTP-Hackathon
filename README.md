# Object Detection and Vehicle Counting

This project focuses on detecting and counting different types of vehicles in video data using YOLO and OpenCV (cv2). The data for the project was provided by IISc and the BTP organization. The primary goal is to identify and track vehicles efficiently.

## About the Project

The project leverages the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm and OpenCV for tracking vehicles in video data. It aims to:
- Detect various types of vehicles (e.g., cars, trucks, bikes).
- Count the number of each vehicle type.
